If it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world 
and gave the Negro Jesus, then it may be said of the Reconstruction era 
that the southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white
man Jim Crow. (Yes, sir) He gave him Jim Crow. (Uh huh) And when his
wrinkled stomach cried out for the food that his empty pockets could
not provide, (Yes, sir) he ate Jim Crow, a psychological bird that 
told him that no matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white
man, better than the black man. (Right sir) And he ate Jim Crow. 
(Uh huh) And when his undernourished children cried out for the 
necessities that his low wages could not provide, he showed them 
the Jim Crow signs on the buses and in the stores, on the streets 
and in the public buildings. (Yes, sir) And his children, too, 
learned to feed upon Jim Crow, (Speak) their last outpost of 
psychological oblivion. (Yes, sir)
