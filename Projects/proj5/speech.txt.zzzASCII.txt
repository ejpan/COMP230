My dear and abiding friends, Ralph Abernathy, and to all of the distinguished 
Americans seated here on the rostrum, my friends and co-workers of the state of 
Alabama, and to all of the freedom-loving people who have assembled here this 
afternoon from all over our nation and from all over the world: Last Sunday, 
more than eight thousand of us started on a mighty walk from Selma, Alabama. 
We have walked through desolate valleys and across the trying hills. We have 
walked on meandering highways and rested our bodies on rocky byways. Some of 
our faces are burned from the outpourings of the sweltering sun. Some have 
literally slept in the mud. We have been drenched by the rains
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. 
This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass 
until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not 
an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off 
steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns 
to business as usual.We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of
dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate 
into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights 
of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which
 has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white 
 people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here 
 today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny.
